# Restaurant clustering using k-means and Sentiment Analysis

In the dynamic landscape of the Indian restaurant industry, Zomato, a prominent restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform, has accumulated a vast dataset reflecting the diverse culinary experiences across different cities. The challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights from this rich dataset to benefit both customers and the company itself.

## 1. Customer Sentiment Analysis

The project aims to delve into the sentiments expressed by customers in their reviews. By employing sentiment analysis techniques, we intend to gauge the overall satisfaction levels of customers with the restaurants listed on Zomato. This analysis will provide actionable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different establishments, aiding both potential diners in making informed choices and Zomato in enhancing its user experience.

## 2. Restaurant Clustering

Another critical aspect of the project involves clustering Zomato's vast restaurant database. By employing appropriate clustering algorithms, we aim to group restaurants with similar characteristics, such as cuisine types, pricing, and user ratings. This segmentation will not only facilitate an organized understanding of the restaurant landscape but also empower Zomato with strategic information to address specific business challenges.

## 3. Business Case Solutions

The insights generated from customer sentiment analysis and restaurant clustering will contribute to solving several business cases. For customers, it will assist in locating the best restaurants in their locality based on peer reviews. Simultaneously, for Zomato, the analysis will pinpoint areas of improvement and growth opportunities, allowing the company to refine its services and cater to evolving customer preferences.
